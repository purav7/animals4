        <p>This project is dedicated to remembering animals that have been lost forever due to human activities. These species once thrived on our planet, contributing to the balance of ecosystems and enriching our world with their unique traits. Unfortunately, due to habitat destruction, hunting, pollution, and other human impacts, they no longer roam the earth.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to honor their memory, raise awareness of the causes behind their extinction, and inspire action to prevent further loss. By learning about the past, we hope to protect the future and save other species from a similar fate.</p>
        <p><em>Explore their stories, learn about the causes of their disappearance, and join us in the commitment to preserving the natural world.</em></p>
